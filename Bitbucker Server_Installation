Java 1.8 installation and Java Home path setting

yum install java -y

insert following content in /etc/profile 

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.161-0.b14.el7_4.x86_64
export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.161-0.b14.el7_4.x86_64/jre
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.161-0.b14.el7_4.x86_64:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.161-0.b14.el7_4.x86_64/jre

========================================
Check your latest versions of Git and Perl
In a terminal or command prompt, run:
yum install git perl -y
git --version
perl --version
The version of Git should be 1.8.x or higher. The version of Perl should be 5.8.8 or higher.

Setting the Bitbucket home directory - it's required lvm mountpoint

Create your Bitbucket home directory (without spaces in the name), and then tell Bitbucket Server where you created it by editing the <Bitbucket Server installation directory>/bin/set-bitbucket-home.sh file â€“ uncomment the BITBUCKET_HOME line and add the absolute path to your home directory. Here's an example of what that could look like when you're done:

#
if ["x${BITBUCKET_HOME}" = "x"]; then
    export BITBUCKET_HOME="/opt/atlassian/bitbucket"
fi

=================================================================================
Bitbucket ports: 

Port 7990: Bitbucket runs on port 7990 by default. If this port is already in use, see Changing the port that Bitbucket Server listens on for more guidance on changing this.
Ports 7992 and 7993: Bitbucket Server's bundled Elasticsearch instance, which is required for search functionality, requires ports 7992 and 7993 be available. This is not configurable, so ensure these ports are available.

==============================================================================

Running Bitbucket Server with a dedicated user:- 


It Should be local. It Should not have admin privileges. It Should be a non-privileged user with read, write, modify and execute access on the Bitbucket Server install directory and home directory.

For Linux, here is an example of how to create a dedicated user to run Bitbucket Server:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/useradd --create-home --home-dir /opt/atlassian/bitbucket --shell /bin/bash atlbitbucket

==============================================================================

Bitbucket installation:

Change to the directory where you downloaded Bitbucket then execute this command to make it executable:

$ chmod a+x atlassian-Bitbucket-X.X.X-x64.bin
Where X.X.X is is the Bitbucket version you downloaded.

Run the installer - we recommend using sudo to run the installer as this will create a dedicated account to run Bitbucket and allow you to run Bitbucket as a service.

$ sudo ./atlassian-Bitbucket-X.X.X-x64.bin
When prompted, choose to start and launch Bitbucket in a browser.
Once installation is complete head to http://localhost:7990 in your browser to begin the setup process.

==============================================================================

Bitbucket server running as a service:- 

Using a systemd unit file

Create a bitbucket.service file in your /etc/systemd/system/ directory with the following lines:

[Unit]
Description=Atlassian Bitbucket Server Service
After=syslog.target network.target
 
[Service]
Type=forking
User=atlbitbucket
ExecStart=/opt/atlassian-bitbucket-X.Y.Z/bin/start-bitbucket.sh
ExecStop=/opt/atlassian-bitbucket-X.Y.Z/bin/stop-bitbucket.sh
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

The value for User should be adjusted to match the user that Bitbucket Server runs as. ExecStart and ExecStop should be adjusted to match the path to your <Bitbucket Server installation directory>.

Enable the service to start at boot time by running the following in a terminal:

systemctl enable bitbucket.service
Stop Bitbucket Server, then restart the system, to check that Bitbucket Server starts as expected.
Use the following commands to manage the service:
Disable the service:
systemctl disable bitbucket.service
Check that the service is set to start at boot time:
if [ -f /etc/systemd/system/*.wants/bitbucket.service ]; then echo "On"; else echo "Off"; fi
Manually start and stop the service: 
systemctl start bitbucket
systemctl stop bitbucket
Check the status of Bitbucket Server:
systemctl status bitbucket
